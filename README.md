# DLG
( PWA fullstack project )

## V5 released !
http://dlg-front.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

This project is my first Angular experience. It's an experimental playground and a request of friends of mine who wanted a simple web site to store lyrics and chords sheets for their band. So this ended with an MEAN pwa. A mini private social network is also included so they can talk and exchange about their new songs or gigs.
